icat-bagit-tool - Export data from ICAT into BagIt packages
===========================================================

This tool implements the export scientific data from an `ICAT`_ into a
BagIt package as defined by the `RDA Research Data Repository
Interoperability WG`__.

.. __: `RDA-rdrinterop`_


System requirements
-------------------

Python:

+ Python 2.7, or 3.2 and newer.

Required library packages:

+ `python-icat`_

+ `bagit`_

+ `lxml`_
  (optional, will fall back on `xml.etree.ElementTree` from the
  standard library if not available.)


Installation
------------

python-icat uses the distutils Python standard library package and
follows its conventions of packaging source distributions.  See the
documentation on `Installing Python Modules`_ for details or to
customize the install process.

1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source directory.

2. Build::

     $ python setup.py build

3. Install::

     $ python setup.py install

The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.


Bugs and limitations
--------------------

+ For the time being, only the export part is implemented.  The tool
  does not support the import of BagIt packages into ICAT.

+ The export script only supports exporting one single investigation
  as a whole.  It is assumed that the investigation is unambiguously
  determind by name and visitId and furthermore that these attributes
  do not contain a colon.  These are mostly a limitations of the
  command line interface of the script and can easily be changed at
  the expense of rendering this interface somewhat more complicated.

+ The package is exported as one single dataset, even though the
  investigation may comprise many datasets in the ICAT schema.  Export
  as a collection of individual datasets is currently not supported.

+ Due to shortcomings in the ICAT schema, the metadata contained in
  the datacite.xml file in the package is not entirely compliant to
  the DataCite schema (e.g. format of names).  Furthermore object
  attributes from the ICAT schema are mapped onto DataCite properties,
  although the semantics of those attributes and properties does not
  always match.  For instance, users related to the investigation in
  ICAT are denominated creator of the dataset in the DataCite
  metadata, which may or may not be correct.

+ Documentation is entirely missing.
