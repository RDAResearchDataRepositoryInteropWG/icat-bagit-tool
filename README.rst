icat-bagit-tool - Export data from ICAT into BagIt packages
===========================================================

This tool implements the export scientific data from an `ICAT`_ into a
BagIt package as defined by the `RDA Research Data Repository
Interoperability WG`__.

.. __: `RDA-rdrinterop`_


System requirements
-------------------

Python:

+ Python 2.7, or 3.2 and newer.

Required Library packages:

+ `python-icat`_

+ `bagit`_

+ `lxml`_


Installation
------------

python-icat uses the distutils Python standard library package and
follows its conventions of packaging source distributions.  See the
documentation on `Installing Python Modules`_ for details or to
customize the install process.

1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source directory.

2. Build::

     $ python setup.py build

3. Test (optional, see below)::

     $ python setup.py test

4. Install::

     $ python setup.py install

The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.


Bugs and limitations
--------------------

+ For the time being, only the export part is implemented.  The tool
  does not support the import of BagIt packages into ICAT.
